# 101 LINQ Examples in .NET Core

[101 LINQ Examples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/101-LINQ-Samples-3fb9811b)
is a great resource for those (like me) who are learning C# and LINQ.

However, I find the format of the examples a bit cumbersome: one solution file
for each set of examples, lots of distracting files in the archive, a web
interface that is hard to read. What I personally care about is just the bare
minimum to read and run the code.

Therefore, as I am also learning my way through .NET Core and Visual Studio
Code, I thought it would be nice to port those examples to .NET Core and
package them in a repo that makes it easy to run them.

TODO: add instructions to execute each example for each platform (Windows,
Linux).
